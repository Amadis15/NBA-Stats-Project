# NBA-Stats-Project
This project aimed to extract data from the NBA Website, convert it to Excel files, clean the data, query the data using SQL, and finally visualize the data. So, in this project, I first visited the NBA.com/leaders website. I wanted to extract the season scoring leaders data that the NBA records yearly. This data basically shows the players that average the most points on a season-by-season basis. The data is also broken down on a playoff-by-playoff basis.

I first picked the year range of the data that I wanted to scrape. I used data from 2013-14 to 2021-22 in this project. I then used Python on Jupyter Notebook to assist me with the data scraping and to convert the regular season and playoff data into 2 separate Excel files. After the files were converted to Excel, I cleaned the data since various columns were in incorrect places, and there were various other issues after the data was converted.

After the data was clean and it was in the state where I wanted it to be. I uploaded both Excel files to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and started performing various queries in order to compare the data from both regular season and playoffs and also to further analyze different aspects of the data. And to finish the project, I visualized the specific queries that I wanted to showcase.
